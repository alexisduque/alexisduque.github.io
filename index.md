Welcome to my webpage !  

I am working towards my PhD thesis at the [CITI laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr) within the INRIA [UrbaNet](http://www.citi-lab.fr/team/urbanet) team, in the framework of French CIFRE fellowships with [Rtone](http://www.rtone.fr).

My PhD is under the joint supervision of [Razvan Stanica](http://perso.citi.insa-lyon.fr/rstanica/) and Adrien Desportes,
Chief Executive Officer at [Rtone](http://www.rtone.fr).

My research subject focuses on Visible Light Communication (VLC) and aims to develop suitable MAC/Application layers for a Smart City environment. Use cases and industrial applications are many, such as indoor localization or infrastructure-to-device communication.
