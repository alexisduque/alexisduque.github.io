On April 7, I've participated in the Visible Light Communication workshop organized in
the context of the SiDO (*Salon de l'Internet des Objet*), in Lyon.
With Adrien Desportes, Stefan Mangold, and Pascal Faradet, we introduced VLC and its usage in the context
of the Internet of Things, giving some concrete use cases.
My [presentation slides](https://speakerdeck.com/alexisduque/using-visible-light-to-make-your-objects-smarter-from-the-laboratory-to-your-home) are
in the [Talks section]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks)
